As robots are increasingly deployed worldwide, they
require mechanisms to efficiently, reliably, and securely
communicate with other robots, sensors, computers, and
the cloud. The applications are broad, from mobile robots
with changing IP addresses due to traveling through different
networks, to a fleet of globally distributed robots learning
collaboratively. Cloud and fog robotics empower robots
and automation systems to harness off-board resources
in cloud-based computers.
