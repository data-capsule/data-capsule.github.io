DataCapsules are secure and replicated containers of data, giving you the abstraction of a Blockchain-in-a-box.
The data structure has a hash-linked DAG structure, where each block of data is also encrypted for confidentiality.
DataCapsule servers allow a single-writer interface with signature checks.
DataCapsules can be migrated to be close to the users making them useful in an edge environment.
